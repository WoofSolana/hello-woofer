# Hello WOOFer !

## Welcome to the WOOF DAO github organization. 

Powered By Community. Designed For ‍Everyone.
A Decentralized Community Coin Building the Web 3.0 Future.


## What is this about?

WOOF is aiming to be the first fully decentralized Social- / Memecoin on Solana, connecting the ecosystem and bringing our part to the open source, web3 community. 

We are planning to make all our developments public and also open up and form teams working on different projects.

If you want to contribute to WOOF you can just send a PR Pull Request and also you might want to join our DAO and Dev Channels on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/woofsolana) and connect to the WOOFPACK !


## Projects

### WOOF DEX

Our [WOOF DEX](https://dex.woofsolana.io) at current point is a Serum/Raydium clone with a personalized style changes and a fee collection for the WOOF DAO Treasury. 

> The repository is public [here](https://github.com/WoofSolana/woof-dex)  - if you want to play with it and/or improve it, send us a pull request with the updates for us to check, we are happy to see your skills! :)


### WOOF SWAP Aggregator

Our (WOOF SWAP) is a decentralized SWAP UI utilizing the (Jupiter SDK)[] for a scan of all order books on the blockchain, for the cheapest and fastest routing for the trade. 
Every SWAP collects a supportive 2.5% fee for the WOOF DAO Treasury.

We also added a script to create the top 100 most volume traded SPL token accounts for your address you use to collect the fees. 
A token account has to exists to be able to collect fees on that specific tokens of the trade happening - those do NOT get created automatically.

> The repository will be set public soon!

### WOOF ESCROW

We are currently building a p2p escrow for NFTs and SPL tokens. 
From our point of view there is a common flaw in how we currently do escrow exchanges and think there can be something done nicer in experience. 

> The p2p is currently under development and will be launched soon. 


### WOOF Project 1

There are plans for a new product we didn't see anywhere else before so war. A mix of fun but also with a reason for existence. More to come!

### WOOF STAKING

The proposal for a vote in that regards is being put together for the DAO. 
If it passes, all repos will be made public ultimately as well.

### WOOF Project 2

Top Secret yet.


### WOOF WEBSITE

We love our current [WOOF Website](https://woofsolana.io), thats for sure. 
However we used a website builder for this as we thought it would be easier for the WOOF Academy to be managed. This turned out to be wrong and also we see another very big point which has made us rethink the current approach. 

The decentralization. 

The current approach of our website is not decentralized but this DAO is all about becoming fully decentralized ultimately. 

So we decided to go back to the roots and code the website again and put it up on github, for everyone to see, edit and improve. 
We saw this approach in other DAOs and think this is the right direction to head for the future of WOOF. 

Plans are to get a Vue.js scaffold going, using Tailwind


We welcome everyone to actively participate to this DAO. 
For the coming Development SubDAO (next to others), certain requirements will have to be fulfilled.
